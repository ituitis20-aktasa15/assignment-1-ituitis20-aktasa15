<a href="http://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

Local Links
The example above used an absolute URL (A full web address).

A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative URL (without http://www....).

Example
<a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a>







HTML Links - The target Attribute
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
_parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame


This example will open the linked document in a new browser window/tab:
Example
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>


Tip: If your webpage is locked in a frame, you can use target="_top" to break out of the frame:
Example
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_top">HTML5 tutorial!</a>

HTML Links - Image as Link

It is common to use images as links:

Example
<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;border:0;">
</a>

Note: border:0; is added to prevent IE9 (and earlier) from displaying a border around the image (when the image is a link).

HTML Links - Create a Bookmark
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page.

Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long.

To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it.

When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

Example
First, create a bookmark with the id attribute:

<h2 id="tips">Useful Tips Section</h2>
Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Useful Tips Section"), from within the same page:

<a href="#tips">Visit the Useful Tips Section</a>
Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Useful Tips Section"), from another page:

Example
<a href="html_tips.html#tips">Visit the Useful Tips Section</a>
