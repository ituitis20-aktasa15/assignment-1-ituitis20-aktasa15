HTML Formatting Elements
In the previous chapter, you learned about the HTML style attribute.

HTML also defines special elements for defining text with a special meaning.

HTML uses elements like <b> and <i> for formatting output, like bold or italic text.

Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Small text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

Note: Browsers display <strong> as <b>, and <em> as <i>. 
However, there is a difference in the meaning of these tags: <b> and <i> defines bold and italic text, 
but <strong> and <em> means that the text is "important".
