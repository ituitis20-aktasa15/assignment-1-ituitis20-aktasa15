The alt Attribute
The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an image cannot be displayed.

The value of the attribute can be read by screen readers. This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, e.g. a blind person, can "hear" the element.

Example
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
